# UWL Campus Safety App

## Overview

The UWL Campus Safety App is a proposed project aimed at enhancing the safety and communication measures within the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse (UWL). The application seeks to provide students, staff, and the UWL Police with a technological tool to aid in ensuring a secure campus environment.

## About the Developers

Marcus Clements, a second-year student in the Computer Science program at UWL;

Alex White, a second-year student in the Computer Science program at UWL;

have proposed the development of this app. With a growing proficiency in software development and customer service, they aim to make this solution a reality for all campus stakeholders.

## Features

There are no official features at this time, as development has not yet begun.

In the meantime, you can view the [Proposed Features](https://uwlax-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/clements8984_uwlax_edu/ERM7KmF8rAVMtS5p7aUUJ04BOfve-LapKEWy_3l8E6IoBQ?e=W3rCYL) document. If you're logged into your UWL Office account, you can leave a comment to suggest a new feature.

I aim to bring our campus solution to Android first, then port it to iOS at a later date.

## Feedback & Collaboration

While we wait for this project to come to life, I have created a form to submit name suggestions for the app!

The development of this app seeks insights and expertise from various stakeholders, including students, UWL Police, dispatchers, and IT staff. If you have suggestions, features or would like to collaborate, please reach out (or submit a pull request!). 

For those interested in the non-technical aspects of this project, such as design, artwork, publicity/marketing, etc., don't be shy! I would love to work with anybody who's interested in making this dream of mine a reality.
